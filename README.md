# Ricochet
Ricochet helps you DCA into ETH using Superfluid's ETHx and USDCx. You open a stream of USDCx to Ricochet and you will receive a distribution of ETHx periodically. In this way, you DCA into ETHx using just a single transaction.  

## Getting Started
1. Install Hardhat
2. `npm install`
3. `npx hardhat test`

## Why Ricochet?
Ricochet only requires one DCA transaction per period for all users, reducing collective transaction quantity exponentially.
